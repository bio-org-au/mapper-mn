Mapper moved to Micronaut framework.

== Introduction

The *Mapper* maps URI *identifiers* to *resources* based on content negotiation. It is the place an ID is created and
mapped to a resource.

From that point on the mapped URI becomes a *permalink* that will always resolve.

The mapper manages de-duplication of resources by allowing you to move a mapping from one resource identifier to
another. It also manages deletion of resources allowing you to provide a reason for deleting a resource, which is
returned with a 410 GONE http response.

You can map a URI to different servers based on the content type requested, e.g. JSON, XML, RDF, HTML.

== Changes

* The broker endpoint is only for resolving IDs. In V1 preferred host and link were also obtained from the
`/broker/preferredLink` endpoint. This complicated the URL resolution for straight redirection brokering
(e.g. a resource proxy) and the API.
* all API calls are now under the `/api/blah`
* endpoints are moving from camel case to skewer case ie. `/broker/preferredHost` -> `/api/preferred-host`
* only serving up JSON, we will not respond with xml on our mapper API as it's not used

== Configuration

The broker uses Regex to pull apart the resolution requests. The Regex used for the broker expects there to be a /broker
in the context path. If you have a proxy in front of the mapper you may need to adjust the context path in this Regex.

You can set it in the nsl-mapper-config-mn.groovy or change the application.yml in the classpath. set the `mapper.brokerRegex`
in the configuration (see below).

The `urlRegex` shouldn't need to be changed, that is used by the mapper to get identities from a given URL.

[source, yaml]
.application.yml
----
mapper:
  brokerRegex: ^(https?://[^/]*)?/broker/(.*?)(/api/.*?)?(\.json|\.xml|\.rdf|\.html)?$
  urlRegex: ^(https?://[^/]*)?/?(.*?)(/api/.*?)?(\.json|\.xml|\.rdf|\.html)?$

=== Configure mapping

An external configuration file is used to configure the resource service to map a URL to.

[source, groovy]
.nsl-mapper-config-mn.groovy
----
import au.org.biodiversity.mapper.Identifier

mapper {
    resolverURL = 'http://localhost:7070/nsl-mapper'
    defaultProtocol = 'http'
    Map serviceHosts = [
            bpni: 'http://bpni.com',
            apni: 'http://apni.com/nsl',
            ausmoss: 'http://ausmoss.com/nsl',
            algae: 'http://algae.net/thing',
            fungi: 'http://fungi.foo',
            foa : 'http://test.biodiversity.org.au/'
    ]

    Closure htmlResolver = { Identifier ident ->
        String host = serviceHosts[ident.nameSpace]
        if (ident.objectType == 'treeElement') {
            return "${host}/services/rest/${ident.objectType}/${ident.versionNumber}/${ident.idNumber}"
        }
        return "${host}/services/rest/${ident.objectType}/${ident.nameSpace}/${ident.idNumber}"
    }

    Closure jsonResolver = { Identifier ident ->
        String host = serviceHosts[ident.nameSpace]
        if (ident.objectType == 'treeElement') {
            return "${host}/services/json/${ident.objectType}/${ident.versionNumber}/${ident.idNumber}"
        }
        return "${host}/services/json/${ident.objectType}/${ident.nameSpace}/${ident.idNumber}"
    }

    format {
        html = htmlResolver
        json = jsonResolver
        xml = htmlResolver
        rdf = {Identifier ident -> return null}
    }
}
