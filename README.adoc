== Introduction

The *Mapper* maps URI *identifiers* to *resources* based on content negotiation. It is the place an ID is created and
mapped to a resource.

From that point on the mapped URI becomes a *permalink* that will always resolve.

The mapper manages de-duplication of resources by allowing you to move a mapping from one resource identifier to
another. It also manages deletion of resources allowing you to provide a reason for deleting a resource, which is
returned with a 410 GONE http response.

You can map a URI to different servers based on the content type requested, e.g. JSON, XML, RDF, HTML.

For info on how it works, data structure and API see: link:doc/guide.adoc[]

== Quick start

link:https://sdkman.io/[SDK Man] is your friend for installing SDKs including Java, Grails etc.

=== Java

You need Java 8 installed and on your PATH. Type `java -version` from the command line to check. You should
get something like:

----
openjdk version "1.8.0_222"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_222-b10)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.222-b10, mixed mode)
----

If you need to install one try (YMMV):

`sdk install java 8.0.222-adpt`

=== Database

1. Install postgresql
2. Create a super user called "nsl" with the password "nsl": `created user -s nsl`
3. edit pg_hba.conf so that local interfaces can talk to postgresql with a password:

[source]
.pg_hba.conf
----
...
# TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD
...
# IPv4 local connections:
host    all             all             0.0.0.0/0               md5 #<1>
...
----

<1> md5 is a hashed password authentication over TCP and listen on all addresses

TIP: Open port 5432 on any local firewall if you are using Docker so that the app can connect.


If you don't have a mapper schema, you can need to create the schema. Get the `test/resource/ddl.sql` from the GitHub
repository and run:

`dropdb --if-exists nsl && createdb nsl && psql -f ddl.sql nsl`

WARNING: Don't drop the nsl database if it has data you want to keep in it! You could just drop the mapper schema.

TIP: You can call your DB something else if you like, just change references to it

=== Config

Make a local configuration file called `nsl-mapper-config-mn.groovy` and put it in a directory like `~/.nsl/ (see the docs/guide.adoc).

This is a basic config that will get you running assuming you have a local database called "nsl" with a user called "nsl" and
password "nsl".

[source]
.nsl-mapper-config-mn.groovy
----
import au.org.biodiversity.mapper.Identifier

mapper {
    resolverURL = 'http://localhost:8080/nsl-mapper'         //<1>
    defaultProtocol = 'http'

    Closure defaultResolver = { Identifier ident ->
        Map serviceHosts = [
                apni: 'https://localhost:8090/nsl'           //<2>
        ]
        String host = serviceHosts[ident.nameSpace]
        if (ident.objectType == 'treeElement') {
            return "${host}/services/rest/${ident.objectType}/${ident.versionNumber}/${ident.idNumber}"
        }
        return "${host}/services/rest/${ident.objectType}/${ident.nameSpace}/${ident.idNumber}"
    }

    format {
        html = defaultResolver
        json = defaultResolver
        xml = defaultResolver
        rdf = {Identifier ident -> return null}
    }

    auth = [
            'TEST-services': [
                    secret: 'buy-me-a-pony',
                    application: 'services',
                    roles      : ['admin'],
            ],
            'TEST-editor': [
                    secret: 'I-am-a-pony',
                    application: 'editor',
                    roles      : ['admin'],
            ]
    ]
}
----

=== Docker

To run the mapper using Docker you need to map the config directory to etc/nsl using -v.

Run the mapper from docker hub:

* `docker run -p 127.0.0.1:7070:8080 -v $HOME/.nsl:/etc/nsl:ro pmcneil/nsl-mapper:2.0`

Note your configuration will need to either use a host name or IP address, not localhost, for the database connection.

See  https://docs.docker.com/v17.12/edge/engine/reference/run/[Publish or expose port (-p, â€“expose)]

TIP: You'll need to open firewall ports for the database connection and the web connection (e.g. 5432 and 8080) if
your OS has a firewall.

Stop the running container using `docker container stop <container ID>` where <container ID> is found using
`docker container ls`.

=== Development

1. make sure you have a database, java and config
2. clone this repository somewhere
3. cd to project directory
4. execute `./gradlew run` from the command line
5. browse to localhost:8080/ to see mapper page

to stop just press CTRL-C.

NOTE: you can change the default port that Micronaut uses by setting the environment variable `MICRONAUT_SERVER_PORT=8086`.
You can also set it in the resources/application.yml see: https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#runningSpecificPort

See: link:doc/guide.adoc[]

==== Testing

run `./gradlew test` after which the test reports will be in `build/reports/test`
